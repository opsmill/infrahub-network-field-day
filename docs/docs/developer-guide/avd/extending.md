## Native schema vs. the escape hatch

When closing a capability gap (for example, to support a new AVD example scenario), decide up front whether to model it **natively** in the schema or pass it through the **`avd_custom_hostvars` escape hatch**:

- **Prefer a native schema change** when the capability is reused across more than one scenario, is a first-class topology/role/protocol concept operators select in the UI, or needs validation, pool allocation, or deterministic generation. Examples: device roles and their `ROLE_TO_AVD_TYPE` mapping, underlay protocol choices, EVPN inputs such as `evpn_vlan_aware_bundles` and EVPN Gateway Groups.
- **Use the `avd_custom_hostvars` escape hatch** when the capability is specific to a single scenario, is a pass-through of PyAVD keys that need no allocation or cross-device derivation, or would be premature to model before real demand. Examples: campus dot1x/PoE/port-profiles/in-band management and MPLS/VPN-IPv4 for ISIS-LDP IPVPN.

`avd_custom_hostvars` is a JSON attribute available at fabric, pod, and device scope. Its content merges with the generator-produced hostvars, and **generator-produced values win** on conflict. Keep escape-hatch content in committed seed data (not manual UI edits) so a design stays reproducible and idempotent, and confirm every key is accepted by the pinned PyAVD version. Escape-hatch use is a deliberate, documented choice per capability — not a default fallback to avoid modeling.

### How the merge composes

The merge has to reach *inside* generated structures, or the escape hatch is unusable wherever the design already models something natively. The rules:

| Both sides are | Result |
|----------------|--------|
| Dicts | Merged recursively |
| Lists of mappings with a shared, unique scalar key | Merged entry by entry on that key |
| Anything else (scalars, lists of scalars, entries with no shared key) | The generated value replaces the override |

Entry identity is resolved from the entries themselves — the first of `name`, `id`, `group`, `profile`, `node`, `ip_address`, `prefix`, `interface_name` that every entry on both sides carries with unique values. That is why `svis[].nodes` (keyed by `node`) and `l3leaf.nodes` (keyed by `name`) both resolve correctly without a path map.

Within a merged entry, precedence is unchanged: the generated value still wins field by field. Entries only the override declares are kept, and entries only the generator produced are appended. Merging is idempotent, so re-generation does not grow a list.

So an override **can** add a static route to a natively-modelled VRF, or a tenant the design does not model, without the generated `tenants` list wiping it. Before this it could not: a replaced list raises nothing, so the override simply vanished from the rendered configuration.

Two deliberate exceptions:

- **`<node_type>.nodes` and `<node_type>.node_groups` are never merged.** Those name devices PyAVD has to resolve facts for, so an override adding one injects a device that does not exist in Infrahub, is not cabled and has no host_vars — an input that fails a long way from its cause. Infrahub owns the topology; the override is discarded, as it always was.
- **AVD adapters are replaced, not merged.** They are identified by `switch_ports`, which is itself a list, so there is no key to match on. An override that needs to change an adapter has to restate it in full.

The contract is pinned in [`tests/unit/test_hostvar_override_merge.py`](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub-network-field-day/blob/main/tests/unit/test_hostvar_override_merge.py).

## Add a new device role

Scenario: you want to support a new Infrahub role (for example, `border-leaf`) that maps to a PyAVD type.

**Touch points:**

1. **Schema** — add the role value to the `DcimDevice` `role` dropdown in [`schemas/dcim_extensions.yml`](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub-arista-avd/blob/main/schemas/dcim_extensions.yml) (the single authoritative device-role list).
2. **Reload the schema and regenerate generated files** — none of these files should be hand-edited:

   ```bash
   uv run invoke load-schema                                             # push schema to Infrahub
   uv run infrahubctl graphql export-schema --destination schema.graphql         # refresh the local GraphQL SDL
   uv run infrahubctl protocols --schemas schemas --out src/solution_arista_avd/protocols.py    # refresh typed protocol classes
   ```

3. **Role map** — add the mapping in [`src/solution_arista_avd/avd.py`](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub-arista-avd/blob/main/src/solution_arista_avd/avd.py):

   ```python
   ROLE_TO_AVD_TYPE: dict[str, str] = {
       ...,
       "border_leaf": "l3leaf",   # or whatever PyAVD type fits
   }
   ```

4. **Hostvars generator** — add a branch for the new role in [`generators/generate_avd_device_hostvar.py`](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub-arista-avd/blob/main/generators/generate_avd_device_hostvar.py) for any role-specific fields (uplink role, MLAG, EVPN data).
5. **Upstream generator** — whichever generator creates devices of this role (fabric/pod/rack/custom) needs to set the `role` attribute correctly and add the device to the `avd_devices` group.
6. **Tests** — add a case in [`tests/unit/test_avd.py`](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub-arista-avd/blob/main/tests/unit/test_avd.py) covering `get_avd_type("border_leaf")`.
7. **Docs** — update [Role Mapping](./role-mapping.md) and, if the role implies new hostvar fields, [Hostvars Reference](./hostvars.md).

## Add a new transform output

Scenario: you want an additional artifact per device or per fabric (for example, a JSON summary, a CSV inventory).

**Touch points:**

1. **GraphQL query** — write the `.gql` query under `transforms/`. Example: `transforms/avd_inventory.gql`.
2. **Pydantic query model** — **do not write this manually.** Generate it with:

   ```bash
   uv run infrahubctl graphql generate-return-types transforms/avd_inventory.gql
   ```

   This reads `schema.graphql` (checked in at the repo root) and emits `transforms/avd_inventory_query.py` alongside the query. Re-run whenever the query or the schema changes. If the schema is stale, regenerate it first with `uv run infrahubctl graphql export-schema` (requires a running Infrahub).
3. **Transform class** — implement the transform in `transforms/avd_inventory.py` as a subclass of the Infrahub Python transform base class. Typical structure:

   ```python
   class AvdInventoryTransform(InfrahubTransform):
       query = "avd_inventory"

       async def transform(self, data: dict) -> str:
           parsed = AvdInventoryQuery.model_validate(data)
           # ... your logic here
           return output
   ```

4. **Register in `.infrahub.yml`**:

   ```yaml
   queries:
     - name: avd_inventory
       file_path: "./transforms/avd_inventory.gql"

   python_transforms:
     - name: avd_inventory
       class_name: AvdInventoryTransform
       file_path: "./transforms/avd_inventory.py"

   artifact_definitions:
     - name: avd_inventory_csv
       targets: fabrics          # or avd_devices, depending on scope
       transformation: avd_inventory
   ```

5. **Tests** — add a unit test under `tests/unit/` exercising `transform()` on a fixture, plus optionally an integration test that hits a running Infrahub.

After merge, operators can open the new artifact from the target node's **Artifacts** tab.

## Add a new field to hostvars

Scenario: you want PyAVD to receive an additional input field (for example, a per-device SNMP location string) that currently isn't populated.

**Touch points:**

1. **Schema** — if the field isn't already represented, add it to the relevant schema (`DcimDevice`, `NetworkFabric`, etc.) in [`schemas/`](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub-arista-avd/tree/main/schemas).
2. **Reload the schema and regenerate generated files**:

   ```bash
   uv run invoke load-schema                                             # push schema to Infrahub
   uv run infrahubctl graphql export-schema --destination schema.graphql         # refresh the local GraphQL SDL
   uv run infrahubctl protocols --schemas schemas --out src/solution_arista_avd/protocols.py    # refresh typed protocol classes
   ```

3. **GraphQL query** — update [`generators/avd_device_hostvar.gql`](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub-arista-avd/blob/main/generators/avd_device_hostvar.gql) to pull the new field.
4. **Pydantic query model** — regenerate, don't hand-edit:

   ```bash
   uv run infrahubctl graphql generate-return-types generators/avd_device_hostvar.gql
   ```

   This rewrites `generators/generate_avd_device_inputs_query.py` from the query and the refreshed schema.
5. **Hostvars builder** — map the new attribute into the PyAVD hostvars dict in [`generators/generate_avd_device_hostvar.py`](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub-arista-avd/blob/main/generators/generate_avd_device_hostvar.py):
    - Device-level, role-independent field → add it in `_build_hostvars()` (where `type`, `fabric_name`, `bgp_as`, loopback/mgmt basics are assembled).
    - Role-specific or multi-attribute field → add the logic in the appropriate role branch of the same file.
6. **Validation** — PyAVD's `validate_inputs()` flags unknown fields as errors. Confirm the field is in the PyAVD input schema for the version pinned (see [overview](./overview.md#pyavd-version)). If it isn't a standard PyAVD field, look at using `custom_structured_configuration_prefix` or `structured_config` pass-through instead.
7. **Tests** — add a case in [`tests/unit/test_hostvar_ordering.py`](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub-arista-avd/blob/main/tests/unit/test_hostvar_ordering.py) for any hostvars logic added to the generator. (`tests/unit/test_avd.py` covers only the role→type mapping in `src/solution_arista_avd/avd.py`.)
8. **Docs** — update [Hostvars Reference](./hostvars.md) with the new field and its Infrahub source.

## Checklist: what to run before opening a PR

- `uv run invoke lint` — ruff, mypy, yamllint must all pass.
- `uv run pytest tests/unit` — all unit tests pass.
- `uv run pytest tests/integration` — integration tests pass (requires a running Infrahub).
- On a feature branch in a live Infrahub, trigger the affected generators twice and confirm idempotence — the second run should be a no-op per [Debugging the Pipeline → checksum-based skipping](./debugging.md#checksum-based-change-detection).
