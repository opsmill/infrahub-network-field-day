## Overview

A check is a Python routine that Infrahub runs during proposed-change validation. Unlike a
transform, it produces no artifact: it reports success, informational messages, or errors, and an
error blocks the proposed change.

Checks live in `checks/` and are registered under `check_definitions:` in `.infrahub.yml`:

```yaml
check_definitions:
  - name: cv-config-validation
    file_path: "./checks/cv_config_check.py"
    class_name: CVConfigValidationCheck
    targets: fabrics
    parameters:
      name: name__value
```

`targets` is a group, exactly as for generators and artifact definitions — `cv-config-validation`
runs once per member of the `fabrics` group, with the fabric name passed as the `name` parameter.

## `cv-config-validation`

**Class**: `CVConfigValidationCheck`
**Source**: [`checks/cv_config_check.py`](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub-arista-avd/blob/main/checks/cv_config_check.py)
**Query**: [`checks/cv_config_check.gql`](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub-arista-avd/blob/main/checks/cv_config_check.gql) (registered as `cv_config_check`)
**Target**: `NetworkFabric` (group `fabrics`)
**Timeout**: 600 seconds

The check deploys each device's rendered EOS configuration into a CloudVision workspace and asks
CloudVision to build it, so a reviewer sees CloudVision's own verdict on the configuration before
the branch merges.

```python
class CVConfigValidationCheck(InfrahubCheck):
    query = "cv_config_check"
    timeout = 600

    async def validate(self, data: dict[str, Any]) -> None:
        parsed = CVConfigCheckQuery(**_normalize_optional_relationships(data))
        ...
```

The flow, in order:

1. Resolve the target fabric from the query response. A fabric with `cloudvision_managed = false`
   skips everything that follows.
2. Read CloudVision credentials from the task-worker environment (`get_cloudvision_config()`),
   and authenticate.
3. Require every confirmed device in the fabric to have a serial number and to exist — and be
   active — in CloudVision inventory.
4. Select the devices that have a stored `AvdStructuredConfigFile`, download each one, and render
   EOS CLI with `pyavd.get_device_config()`.
5. Deploy the configs to a deterministic workspace for this proposed change and fabric, and request
   a build.
6. Record the workspace as a `CloudvisionWorkspace` object and post its URL to a proposed-change
   thread.

Download, JSON-decode, render, connection, deployment, and build failures are all reported as
errors and block the proposed change. The behavioural detail — eligibility rules, workspace naming
and reuse, thread comments, and what happens when the tracking schema is absent — is documented on
the [CloudVision Validation](../cloudvision.md) page rather than duplicated here.

### Optional relationships and the generated query model

`_normalize_optional_relationships()` runs before the generated Pydantic model parses the response.
GraphQL omits nullable relationship selections entirely rather than returning `null`, so a device
with no pod or no `avd_artifact` arrives with the key missing. The helper fills those keys with
`{"node": None}` so an absent relationship parses as absent membership instead of failing
validation.

### Supporting modules

| Module | Holds |
|--------|-------|
| [`checks/cv_helpers.py`](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub-arista-avd/blob/main/checks/cv_helpers.py) | Credential loading from the environment, deterministic workspace ID/name/description/URL derivation, proposed-change context lookup, workspace rollback |
| [`checks/cv_workspace_lifecycle.py`](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub-arista-avd/blob/main/checks/cv_workspace_lifecycle.py) | Workspace threads and comments, and the two submission entry points below |

The two submission entry points in `cv_workspace_lifecycle.py`:

- `submit_linked_workspace_for_custom_webhook()` — the CustomWebhook entry point. It extracts the
  proposed-change ID and branch from the event, ignores events that name a check other than
  `cv-config-validation`, and delegates to the shared handler.
- `submit_linked_workspace_for_proposed_change()` — the shared handler. It resolves
  `CloudvisionWorkspace` objects by proposed-change ID and submits only when exactly one linked
  workspace exists in a submit-ready state (`built` or `submit_failed`).

The manual retry path for the same handler is an invoke task:

```bash
uv run invoke submit-cv-workspace --proposed-change-id <proposed-change-id> --branch main
```

### The webhook payload transform

`cv_workspace_submission_webhook_payload` (`CVWorkspaceSubmissionWebhookPayload`, in
`transforms/cv_workspace_submission_webhook.py`) renders the CustomWebhook body. It is a transform
rather than a check, but it belongs to this pipeline: it returns the check name, the proposed-change
ID, and one entry per linked workspace with its ID, status, URL, and fabric name. See
[Transforms](./transforms.md#cvworkspacesubmissionwebhookpayload).

## `fabric-pool-validation`

**Class**: `FabricPoolValidationCheck`
**Source**: [`checks/fabric_pool_check.py`](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub-arista-avd/blob/main/checks/fabric_pool_check.py)
**Query**: [`checks/fabric_pool_check.gql`](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub-arista-avd/blob/main/checks/fabric_pool_check.gql) (registered as `fabric_pool_check`)
**Target**: `NetworkFabric` (group `fabrics`)

The check validates the role-driven pool collections the generators read — `NetworkFabric.fabric_ip_pools`
and `NetworkPod.pod_ip_pools` — so a pool mistake fails the proposed change instead of producing wrong
addressing at generation time. See [Pool role resolution](./generators.md#pool-resolution) for how the
generators consume the same collections.

Per fabric:

1. Every member of `fabric_ip_pools` must be a `CoreIPAddressPool` or `CoreIPPrefixPool`.
2. Each pool's purpose is resolved from the `IpamPrefix.role` values on its resources; a pool with
   mixed authoritative roles is an error, and two pools claiming the same role in one fabric is an
   error.
3. The required role set depends on fabric intent — the underlay and overlay routing protocols, and
   whether the fabric has DCI links. A required role satisfied only through a legacy relationship
   (for example `NetworkFabric.uplink_pool`) is reported as information, not an error, so migration
   can proceed incrementally.
4. A required role with no pool and no Fabric Supernet to carve one from is an error. When a Fabric
   Supernet does exist, its remaining free space is checked against the prefixes the missing roles
   would need.

Per pod:

1. Members of `pod_ip_pools` are type- and role-checked as above, and the `mlag` and `mlag_peering`
   roles must be address pools rather than prefix pools.
2. MLAG roles required by the pod — driven by the parent fabric's underlay protocol and whether any
   rack enables MLAG — must be present through `pod_ip_pools` or a legacy pod relationship.
3. Pod Loopback, Loopback VTEP, and Fabric Point-to-Point prefixes must be contained by the matching
   fabric pool. A role the fabric leaves to its Fabric Supernet to carve on demand has nothing to
   contain against yet and is skipped rather than reported.

Unit coverage is in
[`tests/unit/test_fabric_pool_check.py`](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub-arista-avd/blob/main/tests/unit/test_fabric_pool_check.py).

## `zone-advertisement`

**Class**: `ZoneAdvertisementCheck`
**Source**: [`checks/zone_advertisement_check.py`](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub-arista-avd/blob/main/checks/zone_advertisement_check.py)
**Query**: [`checks/zone_advertisement_check.gql`](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub-arista-avd/blob/main/checks/zone_advertisement_check.gql) (registered as `zone_advertisement_check`)
**Target**: none — **global**, like `peering-consistency`. Its rules are statements about the whole
graph rather than about one fabric.

`Security.Zone` names the prefix list governing what the datacentre advertises toward it, rather
than relating to one, because no `Routing.PrefixList` object exists — the fabric's whole BGP policy
lives inside `avd_custom_hostvars` as custom AVD structured configuration. A name pointing into a
JSON blob is only defensible if a wrong name is detectable, and this check is what makes it so.

Four rules, each describing a failure that is otherwise silent:

1. A zone names a prefix list the fabric does not declare. The grant generator then has the leaf
   create it, producing a list no route map matches: the route never appears, the firewall still
   permits the session, and nothing errors.
2. A zone carries one half of its advertisement policy and not the other. The schema permits it and
   the generator raises at run time, which is late; this refuses the merge that introduced it.
3. An approved grant's destination VIP falls outside its application's `vip_block`. The cluster only
   advertises addresses from that block, so the session is permitted and unroutable.
4. An approved grant names an application that is not exposed, which gets no pool, no VIP and no
   advertisement at all.

### Why it reads fabric scope only

The subtlety worth knowing before changing rule 1. `generate-app-access` **creates** the named
prefix list at device scope whenever it advertises — that is how the merge composes a grant with the
baseline, described in [Generators](./generators.md#appaccessgenerator). Once a grant has run, the
advertising switch therefore declares the very name the rule questions.

Counting device scope therefore made the reference self-fulfilling: a branch naming a nonexistent
list failed this check before any grant had run and passed it afterwards. A prefix list is declared
where a person authored it, which here is the fabric's own hostvars; a device-scope list the fabric
does not also declare is generator output.

### What it deliberately does not check

Whether the rendered configuration on the border leaf contains the sequence. That lives in an
artifact regenerated by a chain that runs explicitly, so a check reading it would fail for hours at a
time purely because nobody had run `invoke avd` — which would teach people to ignore it.

Unit coverage is in
[`tests/unit/test_zone_advertisement_check.py`](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub-arista-avd/blob/main/tests/unit/test_zone_advertisement_check.py).

## Schema

`schemas/cv/cv.yml` defines `CloudvisionWorkspace` — `Cloudvision.Workspace` — the node the check
writes its workspace tracking to. See [Schemas](./schemas.md#cloudvisionworkspace--cloudvisionworkspace).

## Running and testing a check

Run it against a fabric from the CLI:

```bash
# Variables are passed as key=value; this check takes the fabric name.
uv run infrahubctl check cv-config-validation name=Fabric-L3LS-Multi-Domain --branch <branch-name>

# List the checks the repository defines
uv run infrahubctl check --list
```

In the UI, a check runs automatically as part of proposed-change validation; its result appears
under the proposed change's **Checks** tab.

Unit and integration coverage is in
[`tests/unit/test_cv_integration.py`](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub-arista-avd/blob/main/tests/unit/test_cv_integration.py).
Because the check reaches CloudVision through PyAVD's `CVClient`, tests exercise it with that client
stubbed rather than against a live CloudVision instance.

## Adding a check

1. Write the GraphQL query under `checks/` and register it in the `queries:` block of
   `.infrahub.yml`.
2. Regenerate the matching `*_query.py` — do not hand-write it:

   ```bash
   uv run infrahubctl graphql generate-return-types checks/my_check.gql
   ```

3. Implement a class deriving from `InfrahubCheck`, setting `query` and implementing
   `async def validate(self, data)`. Report through `self.log_info()` and `self.log_error()`; an
   error fails the check.
4. Register it under `check_definitions:` with its `targets` group and `parameters`.
5. Add tests under `tests/unit/`.
